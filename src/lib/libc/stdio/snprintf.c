/**
 * @brief Prints formatted output.
 *
 * @details The snprintf() function is equivalent to sprintf(),
 * with the addition of the @p size argument which states the size
 * of the buffer referred to by @p str. If @p size is zero, nothing
 * is written and @p str may be a null pointer. Otherwise, output bytes
 * beyond the n-1st is discarded instead of being written to the array,
 * and a null byte is written at the end of the bytes actually written into
 * the array.
 *
 * @return Returns number of bytes that would be written to @p str had @p size
 * been sufficiently large excluding the terminating null byte.
