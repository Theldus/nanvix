/**
 * @brief Converts a wide-character string to a character string.
 *
 * @details Converts the sequence of wide-character codes that
 * are in the array pointed to by @p pwcs into a sequence of 
 * characters that begins in the initial shift state and store
 * these characters into the array pointed to by @p s, stopping
 * if a character would exceed the limit of @p n total bytes or
 * if a null byte is stored.
 *
 * @return If a wide-character code is encountered that does not
 * correspond to a valid character (of one or more bytes each),
 * wcstombs() returns (size_t)-1. Otherwise, wcstombs() returns
 * the number of bytes stored in the character array, not including
 * any terminating null byte.
