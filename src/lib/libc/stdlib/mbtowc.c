/**
 * @brief Converts a character to a wide-character code.
 *
 * @details The function determines the number of bytes
 * that constitute the character pointed to by @p s. If
 * the character is valid and @p pwc is not a null pointer,
 * mbtowc() stores the wide-character code in the object pointed
 * to by @p pwc.
 *
 * @return If @p s is a null pointer, mbtowc() returns a non-zero
 * or 0 value, if character encodings, respectively, do or do not
 * have state-dependent encodings. If @p s is not a null pointer,
 * mbtowc() either returns 0 (if @p s points to the null byte), or
 * returns the number of bytes that constitute the converted character
 * (if the next @p n or fewer bytes form a valid character), or returns
 * -1 (if they do not form a valid character).
