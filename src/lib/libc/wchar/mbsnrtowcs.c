/**
 * @brief Converts a character string to a wide-character string (restartable).
 *
 * @details Converts a sequence of characters, beginning in the conversion state
 * described by the object pointed to by @p ps, from the array indirectly pointed
 * to by @p src into a sequence of corresponding wide characters. If @p dst is not
 * a null pointer, the converted characters is stored into the array pointed to by 
 * @p dst. Conversion continues up to and including a terminating null character, 
 * which is also be stored.
 *
 * @return If the input conversion encounters a sequence of bytes that do not form
 * a valid character, an encoding error occurs. In this case, these functions stores
 * the value of the macro [EILSEQ] in errno and returns (size_t)-1; the conversion 
 * state is undefined. Otherwise, these functions returns the number of characters
 * successfully converted, not including the terminating null (if any).
