/**
 * @brief Converts a character to a wide-character code (restartable).
 *
 * @details If @p s is not a null pointer, the function inspects at most
 * @p n bytes beginning at the byte pointed to by @p s to determine the
 * number of bytes needed to complete the next character (including any
 * shift sequences). If the function determines that the next character
 * is completed, it determines the value of the corresponding wide character
 * and then, if @p pwc is not a null pointer, stores that value in the object
 * pointed to by @p pwc. If the corresponding wide character is the null wide 
 * character, the resulting state described is the initial conversion state.
 *
 * If ps is a null pointer, the function use its own internal mbstate_t object,
 * which is initialized at program start-up to the initial conversion state. 
 * Otherwise, the mbstate_t object pointed to by @p ps is used to completely 
 * describe the current conversion state of the associated character sequence.
 *
 * @return Returns 0 if the next @p n or fewer bytes complete the character that
 * corresponds to the null wide character (which is the value stored). between 1
 * and @p n inclusive. If the next @p n or fewer bytes complete a valid character
 * (which is the value stored); the value returned is the number of bytes that 
 * complete the character. Returns (size_t)-2 if the next @p n bytes contribute to
 * an incomplete but potentially valid character, and all @p n bytes have been 
 * processed (no value is stored). When @p n has at least the value of the
 * {MB_CUR_MAX} macro, this case can only occur if s points at a sequence of redundant
 * shift sequences (for implementations with state-dependent encodings). Returns 
 * (size_t)-1 if an encoding error occurs, in which case the next @p n or fewer bytes
 * do not contribute to a complete and valid character (no value is stored).
 * In this case,[EILSEQ] is stored in errno and the conversion state is undefined.
