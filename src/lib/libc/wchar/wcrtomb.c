/**
 * @brief Converts a wide-character code to a character (restartable);
 *
 * @details The main case for this function is when @p s is not NULL
 * and @p wc is not a null wide character (L'\0').  In this case, the
 * function converts the wide character @p wc to its multibyte representation
 * and stores it at the beginning of the character array pointed to by @p s.
 *
 * It updates the shift state @p *ps, and returns the length of said multibyte
 * representation, that is, the number of bytes written at @p s.

 * A different case is when @p s is not NULL, but @p wc is a null wide character
 * (L'\0').  In this case the function stores at the character array pointed to
 * by @p s the shift sequence needed to bring @p *ps back to the initial state,
 * followed by a '\0' byte. It updates the shift state @p *ps (i.e., brings it
 * into the initial state), and returns the length of the shift sequence plus one,
 * that is, the number of bytes written at s.

 * A third case is when @p s is NULL. In this case @p wc is ignored, and the function 
 * effectively returns wcrtomb(buf, L'\0', ps) where buf is an internal anonymous
 * buffer. In all of the above cases, if @p ps is a NULL pointer, a static anonymous
 * state known only to the function is used instead.
 *
 * @return Returns the number of bytes that have been or would have been written to
 * the byte array at @p s. If @p wc can not be represented as a multibyte sequence
 * (according to the current locale), (size_t)-1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.
