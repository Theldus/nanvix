/**
 * @brief Converts formatted wide-character input.

 * @details Reads from the wide-character string @p str. Each
 * function reads wide characters, interprets them according to
 * a format, and stores the results in its arguments. Each expects,
 * as arguments, a control wide-character string format described below,
 * and a set of pointer arguments indicating where the converted input
 * should be stored.
 *
 * @return Returns the number of successfully matched and assigned input
 * items; this number can be zero in the event of an early matching failure.
